	/*
     * Contracts can be defined in multiple ways. The TWS/IB Gateway will always perform a query on the available contracts
     * and find which one is the best candidate:
     *  - More than a single candidate will yield an ambiguity error message.
     *  - No suitable candidates will produce a "contract not found" message.
     *  How do I find my contract though?
     *  - Often the quickest way is by looking for it in the TWS and looking at its description there (double click).
     *  - The TWS' symbol corresponds to the API's localSymbol. Keep this in mind when defining Futures or Options.
     *  - The TWS' underlying's symbol can usually be mapped to the API's symbol.
     *  
     * Any stock or option symbols displayed are for illustrative purposes only and are not intended to portray a recommendation.
